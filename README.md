# Image_Classification
This project is about Image Classification with CNNs using Keras. It uses a subset of CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. 
There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. In this project we use 3 classes instead of 10. The project uses a deep neural network with some Convolutional layers and MaxPooling layers to extract features from the images and classify test images into three classes namely Airplane, Car and Bird.
